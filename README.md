# Dinner Party Decision-making Tool

This is a tool to evaluate which dish(es) (from a series of options) 
you should cook for an upcoming dinner party.

It employs weighted decision-making: you initially specify how important
various criteria are to you, then you make an assessment of each cooking 
option as per those criteria.

The output is an assessment of the best choice.
